### Basic Example: Get Counter Value

```yaml
name: Get Counter
on: [push]

jobs:
  get-counter:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Get counter value
        id: counter
        uses: YourUsername/MyCounter.IO.GitHub.Action@v1
        with:
          apikey: ${{ secrets.MYCOUNTER_API_KEY }}
          workspace: 'my-workspace'
          counter: 'my-counter'
          action: 'get'
      
      - name: Display counter value
        run: echo "Current counter value is ${{ steps.counter.outputs.value }}"
```

### Increment Counter

```yaml
- name: Increment counter
  id: increment
  uses: YourUsername/MyCounter.IO.GitHub.Action@v1
  with:
    apikey: ${{ secrets.MYCOUNTER_API_KEY }}
    workspace: 'my-workspace'
    counter: 'deployment-counter'
    action: 'increment'
    value: '1'  # Optional: increment by 1 (default)
```

### Decrement Counter

```yaml
- name: Decrement counter
  id: decrement
  uses: YourUsername/MyCounter.IO.GitHub.Action@v1
  with:
    apikey: ${{ secrets.MYCOUNTER_API_KEY }}
    workspace: 'my-workspace'
    counter: 'my-counter'
    action: 'decrement'
    value: '5'  # Decrement by 5
```

### Set Counter to Specific Value

```yaml
- name: Set counter value
  id: set-counter
  uses: YourUsername/MyCounter.IO.GitHub.Action@v1
  with:
    apikey: ${{ secrets.MYCOUNTER_API_KEY }}
    workspace: 'my-workspace'
    counter: 'my-counter'
    action: 'set'
    value: '100'  # Set counter to 100
```

### Complete Workflow Example

Here's a complete example that tracks deployment counts:

```yaml
name: Deploy and Track

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
      
      - name: Increment deployment counter
        id: deploy-count
        uses: YourUsername/MyCounter.IO.GitHub.Action@v1
        with:
          apikey: ${{ secrets.MYCOUNTER_API_KEY }}
          workspace: 'production'
          counter: 'deployments'
          action: 'increment'
      
      - name: Deploy application
        run: |
          echo "Deploying application..."
          # Your deployment commands here
      
      - name: Report deployment
        if: steps.deploy-count.outputs.status == 'true'
        run: |
          echo "Deployment #${{ steps.deploy-count.outputs.value }} completed successfully!"
```

## Security

⚠️ **Important**: Always store your MyCounter.IO API key as a GitHub secret. Never commit API keys directly in your workflow files.

To add a secret:
1. Go to your repository settings
2. Navigate to "Secrets and variables" → "Actions"
3. Click "New repository secret"
4. Add your `MYCOUNTER_API_KEY`

## Error Handling

The action will fail if:
- Invalid API key is provided
- Workspace or counter does not exist
- Network connectivity issues
- Invalid action specified

Check the action logs for detailed error messages.
